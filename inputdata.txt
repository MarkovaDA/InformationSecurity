In queueing theory, a discipline within the mathematical theory of probability, Kendall's notation (or sometimes Kendall notation) is the standard system used to describe and classify a queueing node. D. G. Kendall proposed describing queueing models using three factors written A/S/c in 1953[1] where A denotes the time between arrivals to the queue, S the size of jobs and c the number of servers at the node. It has since been extended to A/S/c/K/N/D where K is the capacity of the queue, D is the queueing discipline[2] and N is the size of the population of jobs to be served.
